    "Make sure that you downloaded the Basel Face Model (`01_MorphableModel.mat`) and the Expression Model (`Exp_Pca.bin`) as highlighted in the Requirements section above.

    "The produced files are in the subdirectory created under the `output` directory. The file with expression parameters has the extension `.expressions_smooth` and the pose parameters have the extension `.poses_smooth`. The script above takes approximately 6 minutes to run, and this includes the production of the visualization parameters as well as temporal smoothing. Some tips to reduce total processing time:\n",
    "* *Visualization* (i.e., production of rendering videos) can be disabled by passing the parameter `--produce_3Drec_videos=False`.\n",
    "* *Temporal smoothing* can be disabled by passing the parameter `--smooth_pose_exp=False`\n",
    "* The reconstruction can be sped up by passing the parameter `--cfgid=2` to use the 2nd configuration file, which is faster although results will include more jitter\n",

    "The `process_video.py` script does a series of pre- and post-processing for reconstruction (details are in the section below). It is important to know that we **first estimate the identity parameters** of the subject in the video, by using a small subset of the video frames, and then we compute pose and expression coefficients at every frame. Thus, the identity parameters are held common throughout the video.\n",

    "1. 3D (neutral) identity parameter estimation via 3DI (using a subset of frames from the videos)\n",
